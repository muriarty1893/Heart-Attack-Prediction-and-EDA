# Heart Attack EDA & Prediction (88% Accuracy)

This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prediction modeling on a heart attack dataset to identify risk factors and predict the likelihood of a heart attack with an impressive accuracy of 88%. The notebook is hosted on Kaggle and serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the dataset and building machine learning models for medical predictions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains medical features and labels indicating whether a patient has experienced a heart attack. The features include:
- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Sex**: Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
- **Chest Pain Type (cp)**: 0-3 categories
- **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)**: Measured in mm Hg
- **Cholesterol Level (chol)**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)**: >120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False)
- **Resting ECG Results (restecg)**: 0-2 categories
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**: Numerical value
- **Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)**: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
- **Old Peak (oldpeak)**: ST depression induced by exercise
- **Slope of ST Segment (slope)**: 0-2 categories
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)**: 0-4
- **Thalassemia (thal)**: 1 = Normal, 2 = Fixed Defect, 3 = Reversible Defect

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA involves:
1. **Feature Analysis**: Examining distributions and relationships with the target variable.
2. **Correlations**: Identifying significant features affecting the likelihood of a heart attack.
3. **Visualizations**: Using histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps to explore data trends.

## Prediction Models

Various machine learning models were used to predict heart attack risks:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

The workflow involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical data.
2. **Model Training**: Training models using 80% of the dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Key Insights

- The logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy of 88%.
- Features such as age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate significantly impact predictions.
- The dataset is relatively balanced, ensuring fair model evaluation.

## Additional Features

We have extended the functionality by integrating a user-friendly interface with the following features:
1. **Heart Attack Risk Prediction**: The interface allows users to input medical data and predict the likelihood of a heart attack.
2. **Interactive Map and Hospital Listing**: A single button opens a map interface that:
   - Displays the userâ€™s exact location.
   - Lists nearby hospitals within a 15 km radius.
   - Marks the locations of these hospitals on the map for easy navigation.

## Applications

This project can serve as:
- A foundational guide for beginners in EDA and medical data analysis.
- A practical demonstration of machine learning's role in healthcare.
- A benchmark for building predictive models for heart disease.
- A user-friendly tool for individuals to assess risk and locate nearby hospitals in emergencies.
